Also neatened up the access hatch. As a result I now have very good and easily accessible storage up there. Real gentleman who takes time to explain all the options, I like the way he turns up with the various ladder types on his van so there is no need to make a difficult choice ahead of time, his method of working makes it so easy.",

Kevin arrived on time, with a smile on his face, explained what he was going to do then set about doing it. Considering he had a tricky loft to deal with, he finished the job exceptionally efficiently. I used Kevin to widen the hatch hole, install a new hatch, raise the floor of the loft, board 15 sq. metres and install a new loft ladder. I'd happily recommend Kevin to anybody looking to get their loft boarded.",
